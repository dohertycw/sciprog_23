This folder includes my files for practical 8.

It includes two C files.

it.c contains a function to iteratively calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of any two user input integers. 

rec.c contains a function to recursively calculate the gcd of any two user input integers.

In order to run these files, run the bash script:
        gcc -o <executable_name> it.c -lm
and
	gcc -o <executable_name> rec.c -lm
where <executable_name> is an executable name of your choice, to compile the programmes and then
        ./<executable_name>
to run them.
Within the c file are comments explain how the code works.
