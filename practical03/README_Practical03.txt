This folder includes my file for practical 3.

Integral.c uses the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a given function, in this case tan(x) between 0 and pi/3.

In order to run this file, run the bash script:
	gcc -o integral Integral.c -lm
to compile the programme and then
	./integral
to run it. 
Within the c file are comments explain how the code works.
